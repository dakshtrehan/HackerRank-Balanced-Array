[Balanced Array HackerRank solution](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/world-codesprint-11/challenges/balanced-array)

Given an array of numbers, find index of smallest array element(the pivot), for which the sums of all elements to the left and to the right are equal. The array may not be reordered.

#### Example
arr=[1,2,3,4,6]

- The sum of first three elements, 1+2+3=6, The value of the last element is 6. <p>
Using zero based indexing arr[3]=4 is the pivot between the two subarrays <p>
The index of pivot is 3.
